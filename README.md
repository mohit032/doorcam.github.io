# Doorcam - Beginner Level Project
Doorcam is a beginner-level project aimed at creating a simple doorbell camera system using a Raspberry Pi and a camera module. The project allows you to capture images or videos when someone approaches your door and provides basic motion detection functionality.

## Hardware Requirements
To set up the Doorcam project, you will need the following hardware components:

- Raspberry Pi (any model with camera module support)
- Camera module compatible with your Raspberry Pi model
- MicroSD card with Raspbian or Raspberry Pi OS
- Power supply for Raspberry Pi
- Internet connectivity (Ethernet or Wi-Fi)
- Optional: Housing or enclosure for Raspberry Pi and camera module

## Software Requirements
The Doorcam project relies on the following software components:

- Python 3
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
- Raspberry Pi OS or Raspbian
- Any required Python libraries specified in the project documentation

## Installation
To install and set up the Doorcam project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
``` git clone https://github.com/mohitrajput2002/Doorcam-project.git ```
2. Install any required Python libraries specified in the project documentation.
3. Connect the camera module to your Raspberry Pi following the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Configure your Raspberry Pi and ensure that the camera module is enabled in the Raspberry Pi settings.
5. Run the Doorcam application using the appropriate command specified in the project documentation.

## Usage
1. Connect your Raspberry Pi to a power source and ensure it has an internet connection.
2. Run the Doorcam application on your Raspberry Pi.
3. The application will continuously monitor for motion using the camera module.
4. When motion is detected, the application will capture an image or record a video, depending on the project configuration.
5. Check the specified output location to view the captured images or videos.
6. Adjust the application settings and configuration files as needed to customize the behavior of the Doorcam project.

**Enjoy using Doorcam for your doorbell camera system!**
